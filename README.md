# Phase 1 – Mini Project

In this lab, we will create a small program that will use the following skills learned in phase 1:
- Manipulating string data
- Navigating a json/dictionary data structure
- Sending a request to an api and collecting the response
- Scraping data from a webpage
- Data Vizualization

## Your Task

In this notebook, you will write nine functions. When used together, these functions produce a simple python application that receives a date and outputs a report detailing the following:
- Whether or not the day was a public holiday
- What historical events occured on that day
- The top 5 stock price increases and decreases for that day. 



### Specifically this program will...

1. Receive a date formatted as `month/day/year`
1. Parse the date to create individual variables for 
    - Month (string)
    - Day (string)
    - Year (string)
    - Month Name (string)
1. Query the public holidays api to check if the date was a holiday.
1. Connect to the `www.onthisday.com` website and scrape the `Important Events` listed for a given date.
1. Manipulate a dataset of stock information and find the 5 largest stock increases and declines for an inputted day.
1. Visualize the top five increases and declines using subplots.

The goal is to produce a function that will have an output like the one seen below. Some code has been provided to generate the report itself, your job is to write the functions to collect and organize the data, and we'll do the rest.

```

## Task 1

In the cell below, define a function called `parse_date`.

This function should 
- Receive a single argument `date` with a datatype of string.
- The expected format of the string should be `month/day/year` where both month and day are integers.
- Parse the date variable to seperate the month and day integers.
- Map the month integer to the name of the month using the provided dictionary
- Returns the month (string), the day (string), and the name of the month (string)

An example output for this function would look as follows:

```python
parse_date('06/03/2015')
>> ('06', '03', '2015' ,'June')
```


```python
def parse_date():
    month_map =  {1: 'January', 2: 'February', 3: 'March',
                  4: 'April', 5: 'May', 6: 'June', 7: 'July',
                  8: 'August', 9: 'September', 10:'October', 
                  11: 'Novembers', 12: 'December'}
    
    # Your code here
```


```python
#==SOLUTION== 
def parse_date(date):
    
    mapper = {1: 'January', 2: 'February', 3: 'March',
              4: 'April', 5: 'May', 6: 'June', 7: 'July',
              8: 'August', 9: 'September', 10:'October', 
              11: 'Novembers', 12: 'December'}
    month, day, year = date.split('/')
    return month.zfill(2), day.zfill(2), year, mapper[int(month)]
```

## Task 2

In the cell below, define a function called `holidays_api` 

This function should do the following:

- Receive a single argument called `year` with a datatype of string.
- Connects to the [Public Holidays API](https://date.nager.at/Api) and returns the public holidays data for the inputted year.

An example output of this function would look like this:

```python
holidays_api('2015')
>> [{'date': '2015-01-01',
  'localName': "New Year's Day",
  'name': "New Year's Day",
  'countryCode': 'US',
  'fixed': False,
  'global': True,
  'counties': None,
  'launchYear': None,
  'type': 'Public'},
```


```python
# Your code here
```


```python
#==SOLUTION== 
def holidays_api(year):
    url = f'https://date.nager.at/Api/v2/PublicHolidays/{year}/US'
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
```

## Task 3

In the cell below, define a function called `is_public_holiday` that receives four arguments
1. month - integer
2. day - integer
4. year - integer
3. holiday_data - list

This function should:
- Loop over the holiday_data list and check if the date is found within the data. If the date is not found, the function should return None. If a date is found, the function should return the name of the holiday.

An example of this function's output looks like this:

```python
is_public_holiday('09', '07', '2015', holiday_data)
>>> 'Labour Day'
```


```python
# Your code here
```


```python
#==SOLUTION== 
def is_public_holiday(month, day, year, holiday_data):
    date = f'{year}-{month}-{day}'
    for holiday in holiday_data:
        if holiday['date'] == date:
            return holiday['name']
```

## Task 4

In the cell below define a function called `get_historical_events` that scrapes the historical events for a given day.

This function should receive 2 arguments:
1. The name of a month
2. The day of the month.

The url format for this problem is as follows:

`f'https://www.onthisday.com/day/{month_name}/{day}'`

This function should return a list of strings for each historical event for the inputted date.

The desired output looks like this 

```python
get_historical_events('July', '07')
>> ['1520 Battle of Otumba, Mexico: Hernán Cortés and the Tlaxcalans defeat a numerically superior Aztec force',
 '1937 Japanese and Chinese troops clash at the Marco Polo Bridge, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War',

    soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
    events = soup.find_all('li', {'class': 'event'})
    event_details = [event.text for event in events]
    return event_details
```

## Task 5

A `json` data file containing stock data is stored in the `data` folder of this repository with the filename `stock-data.json`.

In the cell below
- Open a connection to the stock data file using the python `open` function. 
- Load the contents of the file into the variable `data` using the `json` library. 
- Ensure the connection to the stock data file is closed. 


```python
# Your code here
```


```python
#==SOLUTION==
import json

# Open a connection to the stock data file
# using the python `open` function
file = open('data/stock-data.json', 'r')

# Load the contents of the file into the variable
# `data` using the json library
data = json.load(file)

# Ensure the connection
# to the stock data file is closed
file.close()
```

## Task 6

The next three tasks will focus on pulling information out of the `data` variable. 

Let's first write a function that will find the stock data for every company that occurs on a specific date. 
 

#### `get_companies`

This function has the following inputs:

- month: String. 
- day:   String
- year:  String.
- data:  Dictionary. 

This function should return:

- List. The stock information for every company for the inputted date. 


```python
def get_company_stocks(month, day, year, data):
    # Create a string variable called `date`
    # that has the following format:
    # `year-month-day`
    #===============
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #===============
    # Create an empty list
    # called `found_stocks`
    #===============
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #===============
    
    # Loop over the company names in the data variable
    #===============
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #===============
    
        # Loop over the stock entries for the company
        #===============
        # YOUR CODE HERE
        #===============
            # Check if the date in the stock entry
            # is equal to the `date` variable
            #===============
            # YOUR CODE HERE
            #===============
                # Add the name of the company
                # to the stock entry
                #===============
                # YOUR CODE HERE
                #===============
                # Append the entry to the 
                # `found_stocks` list
                #===============
                # YOUR CODE HERE
                #===============
                
    # Return the found stocks
    #===============
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #===============
```


```python
#==SOLUTION==
def get_company_stocks(month, day, year, data):
    # Create a string variable called `date`
    # that has the following format:
    # `year-month-day`
    date = f'{year}-{month}-{day}'
    
    # Create an empty list
    # called `found_stocks`
    found_stocks = []
    
    # Loop over the company names in the data variable
    for company in data:
        # Loop over the stock entries for the company
        for entry in data[company]:
            # Check if the date in the stock entry
            # is equal to the `date` variable
            if entry['date'] == date:
                # Add the name of the company
                # to the stock entry
                entry['name'] = company
                # Append the entry to the 
                # `found_stocks` list
                found_stocks.append(entry)
    
    # Return the found stocks
    return found_stocks
```

## Task 7

The stock data does not actually have information about price changes. It only has the opening and closing prices for each day.

Let's define a function that will loop over stock entries and calculate the price change that took place on that day. 

#### `get_price_changes`

This function has the following inputs:

- found_stocks: List. The stock information for every company for a specific day. 

This function should return:

- List. A list sorted in descending order of price changes (close-open)
    - The list should contains tuples with the following format:
    ```(Name of company, Price change)```


```python
def get_price_changes(found_stocks):
    # Create an empty list
    # called `price_changes`
    #===============
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #===============
    
    # Loop over the entries in the
    # `found_stocks` variable
    #===============
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #===============
        # Calculate the price change for the entry
        #===============
        # YOUR CODE HERE
        #===============
        # Create a tuple variable with the 
        # format `(Company name, Price change)`
        #===============
        # YOUR CODE HERE
        #===============
        # Append the tuple to the
        # `price_changes` list
        #===============
        # YOUR CODE HERE
        #===============
        
    # Sort the `price_changes` list in descending order
    #===============
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #===============
    # Return the sorted price changes
    #===============
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    #===============
```


```python
#==SOLUTION==       
def get_price_changes(found_stocks):
    # Create an empty list
    # called `price_changes`
    price_changes = []
    
    # Loop over the entries in the
    # `found_stocks` variable
    for entry in found_stocks:
        # Calculate the price change for the entry
        change = entry['close'] - entry['open']
        # Create a tuple variable with the 
        # format `(Company name, Price change)`
        obsv = (entry['name'], change)
        # Append the tuple to the
        # `price_changes` list
        price_changes.append(obsv)
        
    # Sort the `price_changes` list in descending order
    sorted_changes = sorted(price_changes, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    # Return the sorted price changes
    return sorted_changes
```

Ok, now let's define a function that will call the previous two functions, and then return information about the companies that saw the best stock increases and worst stock decreases on a given day. 

## Task 8

#### `find_top_stock_changes`

This function has the following inputs:

- month: String. 
- day:   String
- year:  String.
- data:  Dictionary. 

This function should return four lists:
1. A list of 5 stock names with the highest increases on the inputted day
2. A list of 5 stock names with the highest declines on the inputted day
3. A list of the 5 stock changes for top increases
4. A list of the 5 stock changes for top declines.


An example of this function's output looks like this:
```python
find_top_stock_changes('09', '08', '2015', data)

## Task 9

In the cell below, define a function that receives 4 arguments
1. increase_names - A list of 5 stock names with the highest increases 
2. decline_names - A list of 5 stock names with the highest declines
3. increase_change - A list of the 5 stock changes for top increases
4. decline_change - A list of the 5 stock changes for top declines.


This function should:

- Output two bar charts next to each other the show the increases and declines for the inputted stock changes.

This function's output should look like this:
